"""``DiscretePPOTrainer`` — Phase 2, Session 02 deliverable.

Wraps Session 01's :class:`RolloutCollector` + :func:`compute_per_runner_gae`
into a self-contained PPO update path for the v2 discrete-action policy.

What this owns:

* The PPO surrogate loss (clip-ratio on the joint
  ``Categorical × Beta`` log-prob, with the stake log-prob masked out
  for NOOP / CLOSE actions).
* Per-runner value loss against the per-runner GAE return.
* Entropy bonus (categorical only — Beta entropy is intentionally not
  added; the stake head's role is sizing, not exploration).
* Per-mini-batch KL early-stop (CLAUDE.md §"Per-mini-batch KL check").
* Hidden-state pack / slice handshake with the policy
  (CLAUDE.md §"Recurrent PPO: hidden-state protocol on update").

What this does NOT own:

* Real-day training, multi-day epochs, GA / cohort, frontend events
  — Phase 2 Session 03 + Phase 3.
* Reward shaping. The trainer consumes whatever ``shim`` /
  ``BetfairEnv`` produced; per-runner attribution lives in
  :mod:`training_v2.discrete_ppo.rollout`.
* v1 stabilisers (advantage normalisation, LR warmup, reward
  centering, entropy controller) — rewrite hard constraint §6.

Hard constraints honoured here (rewrite README §3, phase-2 purpose
§"Hard constraints", session prompt §"Hard constraints"):

- No env edits.
- No re-import of ``agents/`` (v1) — read for reference, never import.
- The PPO update reads transitions from Session 01's
  :class:`Transition` verbatim; no shape changes, no field additions.

        For each step in the mini-batch where ``mature_mask_step`` is
